# ant-game
Interesting ant, spider, snake game
consisting of ant, whose job is to pick the leaves fallen and will get back to their coloney. Once every single leaf is taken they will 
all get back to their home.
another entity is spider which whose work is to eat the ant and ant will run from spider if it gets too close, if ant is carrying any leaf 
it will drop that leaf and run.
next entity is snake whose job is to eat spider (it wont do any damage to ants) and spider will run away from it. Once every spider is eaten
it will get back to its burrow.
you can deploy 50 leaves with L key, 10 ant with A key , one spider with S key, and one snake with D key.
And one mode thing spider can eat maximum upto 20 ant then it will will die after turning red.
Originally you dont have to do anything to control any entity just deplow then and they will do their job on their on.
if you cant run .exe file you can try both .pyc (compiled python files ) to run (if you have python installed)
